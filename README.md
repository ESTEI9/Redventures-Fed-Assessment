# Overview for RedVentures FED Assessment

### Summary

This project was made to test my skills in Front-End Development for Redventures in Charlotte, NC.

### Technical Concepts Covered

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Javascript
* jQuery

### Notes

This project was actually quite difficult in comparison to the Ally Assessment.

1. There were significant differences between the mobile and desktop versions with some semantic changes. These differences were sometimes noticible and other times less.
2. It's possible that there are errors in my completed assessment since some of the changes didn't make sense to me as a developer.
3. I'm not used to coding such large CSS files (~1000 lines) and I didn't do it with a compiler like SCSS or LESS because I wanted them to see my raw capability for custom CSS styling.

All said and done, I'm sure I made semantic errors in the HTML, CSS and Javascript that could have been avoided. The whole project was rushed on my part since I wanted to turn this in by a certain timeframe. For a much cleaner example of my work, please look at my Ally assessment.
