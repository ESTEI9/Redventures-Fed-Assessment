###Notes

This project was actually quite difficult in comparison to the Ally Assessment. 
There were major differences between the mobile and desktop versions with some odd semantic changes. These differences were sometimes noticible and other times less.
It's possible that there are errors in the assessment since some of the changes didn't make sense to me as a developer and appeared to be created with competing ideas.
I don't think this was the creator of a singular graphic designer within a single session. As a result of these differences, the HTML code was only about 200 lines, but the CSS was almost 1000 for a single page application.
I'm not used to coding such large CSS files and I didn't do it with a compiler like SCSS or LESS because I wanted them to see my raw capability for custom CSS styling.
That being the case, I'm sure I made CSS selector semantic errors, that, if created in a SCSS file, may have been avoided. The whole project was rushed on my part since I wanted to turn this in by a certain timeframe.
